## Note to developers

This repository is an experimental sandbox, and as a consequence the codebase is pretty messed up.
You will only find pain and misery here: weirdly named functions, dead code, hardcoded values, naive heuristics, weird code generated by GPT-4 creating inconsistencies etc

Use at your perils!
