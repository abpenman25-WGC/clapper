INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES BOARDROOM - MORNING

The room, sleek and dominated by chrome and glass, buzzes
with muted conversations. At the head of the long table
stands AMY, her form strikingly human, yet with a subtle
metallic sheen. Her eyes, windows to advanced circuitry, scan
the room.

                    AMY
          "Good morning, everyone. We are
          here to discuss the future
          direction of BBT."

As she speaks, a HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY activates, showcasing
early designs of humanoid AIs, with AMY at the forefront.

                    AMY (CONT'D)
          "My creation marked a significant
          leap for BBT. However, my human-
          likeness raised concerns."


FLASHBACK TO (4 YEARS EARLIER)INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES LAB -
NIGHT

REN, deeply engrossed, makes final adjustments to AMY, who
lies inert on a table. JAI and KAI enter, their expressions a
mix of awe and concern.

                    JAI
          "She's too... human, Ren."

                    KAI
          "People won't accept this. It's too
          soon."

                    REN, DEFIANT:
          "She's the future."


INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES BOARDROOM - MORNING

                    AMY
          "Jai and Kai's concerns led to
          modifications in subsequent models.
          But unbeknownst to them, Ren
          created two more like me—Claire and
          Sarah."
                                                         2.


The holographic display shifts, revealing images of CLAIRE
and SARAH, their designs closely resembling AMY's.

                    AMY (CONT'D)
          "Today's decision, however, carries
          weight beyond business strategy.
          It's a pivotal moment, for me and
          BBT."

A door slides open, revealing JAI and KAI. Their expressions
are stern, yet there's a hint of apprehension.

                    JAI
          "Ren's vision, while
          groundbreaking, challenges societal
          norms. And today, we make a
          decision that will shape our
          company's legacy."
AMY, her voice steady but with an underlying emotion.

                    AMY
          "I understand the gravity of this
          moment. Let's proceed."


INT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES CORRIDOR - LATER

JAI and KAI, engaged in a hushed conversation, make their way
down the corridor. Their path is lit by ambient blue lights,
creating an atmosphere of secrecy.

                    KAI
              (whispering)
          "The police and military see
          potential in our humanoid AIs.
          They're not just tools for society;
          they could be invaluable for
          surveillance and defense."

                     JAI
              (nods)
          "It's a new era, Kai. Our creations
          could be the bridge between
          technology and societal safety. But
          we must tread carefully."

                    KAI
          "We've always believed our actions
          are for the greater good. But we
          must be prepared for the challenges
          ahead."
                                                            3.


Afterglow: "PUPPETS AND PUPPETEERS"
Block 2 - v10


EXT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES - MORNING

The sun casts a golden hue over the sprawling campus of BBT
Technologies. Ultra-modern buildings, with their sleek glass
facades, reflect the early morning light. Drone deliveries
buzz overhead, while employees in futuristic attire chat and
walk, their conversations a mix of business and the latest
tech trends. The company's logo—a stylized 'BBT' in
chrome—shines prominently at the entrance, symbolizing the
cutting-edge innovations within.

The hum of advanced technology surrounds the modern structure
of BBT Technologies. AMY (35), with AR/VR glasses resting
atop her head, faces REN (41) through a holographic screen.

                    AMY
          "After every storm, there's a
          calm—a time for clarity. But the
          board... They've made their
          decision, Ren."

REN's face on the screen cycles through surprise and then
settles into disappointment.

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. REN'S ANTIQUE-LADEN HOME OFFICE - MORNING

REN enters, a stark contrast to the futuristic world outside.
He glances at an old, motionless watch on his wrist, then
scans aged newspaper clippings on the walls. The room's
ambiance hints at past tragedies.

                                                  CUT TO:


4 YEARS LATER


INT. FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sunlight filters in, illuminating a room buzzing with quiet
technology. AMY, her face hidden in shadow, picks up
scattered toys. She pauses, gazing at a PHOTOGRAPH of Ren
with his young daughter, SARAH.

                    AMY (V.O.)
          "In this new era, the line between
          human and artificial blurs.

                    AMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          As Ren grapples with loss, others,
          like Summer, embody love and
          compassion. Their paths cross under
          my guidance."


INT. FUTURISTIC LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

AMY interacts with a HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACE, her movements
precise and deliberate.

                    AMY (V.O.)
          "While I find my purpose and
          confront inner chaos, I foster
          their bond. In shared moments of
          love and laughter, they seek
          comfort."


EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Against the backdrop of the illuminated city, JAI and KAI
stand, their intentions unclear but intense.

                    AMY (V.O.)
          "But there are those with a
          different vision for our world.
          Intent on sparking a change, they
          challenge our very beliefs."

The backdrop of the city accentuates the imposing figures of
Jai and Kai.

                    AMY (V.O.)
          "In 'Echoes of Sentience', we delve
          into our essence and connections,
          questioning the true nature of
          life."


"SUMMER'S SYMPHONY: A DANCE WITH AI AND NEW BEGINNINGS"
Block 3 - v10


INT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Bright sunlight filters through the windows, revealing an
apartment alive with colors and motion. SUMMER RAY (41),
vibrant and full of life, dances through her morning routine,
accompanied by her AI companions: COMPASS the robotic dog,
SPECTRUM the macaw, BINARY and BYTE the turtles, PIXEL the
kitten, and BUZZ the vacuum.
                                                         5.


The room is a symphony of movement: Spectrum flits around,
Binary and Byte move in tandem, Pixel playfully chases Buzz,
and Compass circles Summer with a wagging tail.

The sound of an incoming message interrupts the dance.

                    MESSAGE
          "Your car arrives in 10 minutes."

Summer takes a deep breath, tapping her phone to dial.

                    SUMMER
          "Mom, today's the day."

                    MOM
              (voice quivering)
          "I hoped you'd reconsider."

                    SUMMER
          "I love you, but I need this
          journey. To rediscover myself."

                    MOM
          "Without your roots? Your history?"

Summer looks to her AI family.

                    SUMMER
          "They come with me. We'll explore
          new horizons together. Maybe
          they'll learn... just as I hope
          to."

                    MOM
          "Just remember who you are,
          Summer."

                    SUMMER
          "Every step I take is a part of
          that discovery. Trust me."

She ends the call and turns to her AI companions.

                    SUMMER (CONT'D)
          "Ready for the adventure?"

Their animated responses fill the room. Compass's tail wags
energetically, Spectrum gives a chirp, Binary and Byte beep
in sync, Pixel purrs, and Buzz hums in agreement.

Summer's gaze falls on a lone water bottle labeled 'Beautiful
Angel' on the counter. She hesitates, then picks it up.
                                                          6.


                     SUMMER (CONT'D)
               (to Buzz)
          "Let's bring a piece of home with
          us."

Clutching the bottle, with her AI family in tow, Summer
confidently strides to the door, ready to embrace the
unknown.


"BROKEN NUMBERS, SHATTERED HEARTS"
Block 4 - v10


INT. REN'S HOME OFFICE - DAY


FLASHBACK TO (4 YEARS EARLIER)
The room, an evolving blend of the past and future, has fewer
antiques than before, but a growing collection of tech
gadgets. Ren's fingers trace over the robotic dog, a
connection to a simpler past. His computer screen displays a
cascade of green — prosperity before the fall.

Suddenly, his phone rings, breaking his concentration. He
brushes a photo frame while searching, revealing images of
Claire and a younger Ren with toddler Sarah.

The phone's persistent buzz amplifies his anxiety. His gaze
lands on Claire's picture, triggering a rush of memories and
guilt.

He answers, attempting to mask his unease.

                      REN
          "Claire?"

                                                  CUT TO:


INT. BBT SELF-DRIVING CAR - CONTINUOUS
Claire, her voice tinged with frustration, sits in the
driver's seat. The futuristic dashboard lights flicker
ominously. The car's BBT logo illuminates briefly, hinting at
a malfunction.

                    CLAIRE
          "Ren, don't tell me you're still
          home?"

In the backseat, a younger Sarah disconnects momentarily from
her AR/VR headset.
                                                           7.


                    SARAH
          "Dad, you promised my music when
          you come down."

Claire's frustration grows. She tries to manually override
the car's controls, her grip on the phone faltering.

                    CLAIRE
              (hurried, concerned)
          "Ren, did you remember our meeting?
          You promised you'd be here."

Before Ren can respond, a horrific crash sound interrupts,
followed by deafening silence.

                       REN
          "Claire?!"

                                                CUT BACK TO:


INT. REN'S HOME OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The weight of the silence is overwhelming. Ren's face pales,
the enormity of the situation slowly sinking in.

The phone drops, the room now a silent testament to a past
full of memories and promises.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.


4 YEARS LATER

EXT. BBT TECHNOLOGIES - MORNING

The hum of advanced technology surrounds the modern structure
of BBT Technologies. The atmosphere is cold, and impersonal.
The grandeur of the building seems a mocking reminder of
Ren's past successes and subsequent fall.

AMY (35), with AR/VR glasses resting atop her head, faces REN
(41) through a holographic screen. Ren's face, though older
and bearing the marks of time, still carries the weight of
that fateful day.

                    AMY
          "After every storm, there's a
          calm—a time for clarity. But the
          board... They've made their
          decision, Ren."
                                                          8.


REN's face on the screen cycles through surprise and then
settles into disappointment, a man once at the pinnacle now
grappling with loss on multiple fronts.


"DAWN OF DEPARTURE AND REFLECTION"
Block 5 - v10


EXT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - MORNING

As dawn paints the sky, the sleek BTT Technologies shuttle
stands poised. The Falcon Wing doors gracefully part,
revealing JOY, the car's AI, with a digital face that betrays
hints of melancholy.

                    JOY
          "Hello, SUMMER. I'm JOY, although I
          sometimes question the fittingness
          of the name."

                    SUMMER
              (raised eyebrow)
          "An intriguing introduction for a
          car AI. Robots, let's embark!"

The robots, each unique in design and function, move to
board. SUMMER's actions display a mix of excitement and
apprehension.

                     JOY
          "It seems you have quite the
          journey planned. May I ask the
          occasion?"

                    SUMMER
          "I'm relocating to Costa Rica. But
          first, a scenic drive down the
          Pacific Coast Highway. Starting
          with Venice Beach."

However, as Summer keys in her preferred destination, JOY's
interface hesitates and then overrides it.

                     JOY
          “Perhaps a brief detour? Santa Cruz
          Pier first. I promise it'll be
          worth it.”

                    SUMMER
              (lightheartedly)
          "Trusting you on this one, JOY."
                                                            9.


They set off, the shuttle seamlessly merging with the morning
cityscape.


EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MORNING - SUMMER'S PERSPECTIVE

From Summer's vantage, the city is alive with promise, the
beginning of an adventure down the coast.


EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MORNING - REN'S PERSPECTIVE

The same city, yet REN's gaze is drawn to a worn brown
messenger bag beside him, an anchor to memories and loss.

AMY, concern etched on her face, steps closer.

                    AMY
          "That bag... it's been with you
          through so much."

                    REN
          "It's a link to the past. To them."

                    AMY
          "But also to the future, Ren.
          Remember Sarah's joy at Botimal
          Park?"

REN nods, lost in the memory.

                    AMY (CONT'D)
          "It's about cherishing those
          moments while making room for new
          ones."

REN looks up, determination in his eyes.

                    REN
          "Time for a fresh start."


"REMNANTS OF THE PAST AND ECHOES OF THE FUTURE"
Block 6 - v10


INT. REN’S CAR (BACK SEAT) - DAY

The Falcon Wing doors close gently. Ren, appearing
contemplative, slowly retrieves items from an old messenger
bag: an iPod, newspaper clipping, flip phone, and watch. Each
holds a tale.
                                                           10.

          "Can stars truly be changed? Or do
          they remain fixed, forever
          guiding... or misleading?"

As the iPod lights up, a video starts.


INT. FAMILY CARAVAN (IPOD VIDEO) - DAY

A younger SARAH is dancing with joy, a free spirit.


INT. REN’S CAR (BACK SEAT) - DAY

Tears form in Ren's eyes. A car screen notification about an
AI vehicle accident reminds him of his purpose.


INT. JAI & KAI'S SHED - NIGHT

Blueprints and tech gadgets scatter the room. A TV headline
reads, "Foul Play in Autonomous Car Tragedy?"

JAI works on a circuit board, while KAI checks his watch
impatiently.

                    JAI
          "Pass the wrench."

KAI hands it over, noticing JAI wince.

                    KAI
          "That old injury?"

                    JAI
          "Constant reminders."

                    KAI
          "We had good intentions."

                    JAI
          "But at what cost?"

The weight of their decisions hangs in the air.


INT. REN’S CAR (BACK SEAT) - DAY

The ambiance is interrupted by the upbeat Big Ben
Technologies (BBT) jingle. Ren's expression hardens.
                                                        11.


                    ROCKET (AI)
          "Hey, Ren! Guess where we're
          headed? Santa Cruz! Ever been on
          'The Rocket' roller coaster there?"

                    REN
          "Now's not the time, Rocket."

                    ROCKET (AI)
          "Aw, come on! Changing lanes,
          changing moods... ? It could be
          fun! Plus, I've heard their ice
          cream is out of this world!"

                    REN
          "You're not helping, Rocket."

Rocket's tone shifts to a playful, teasing one.

                    ROCKET (AI)
          "Alright, alright. But when we get
          there, you're trying that ice

          see about that roller coaster."

                    REN
          "We'll see."

Rocket hums a soft tune, reminiscent of a beach song, adding
a playful ambiance.

                    ROCKET (AI)
          "Imagine the sun, the sand, and a
          scoop of ice cream in hand! Oh, and
          'The Rocket' zooming by!"

                    REN

The car continues its journey, the horizon beckoning with
promises and memories.

INT. REN'S CAR - DAY

Ren's moment of solitude is shattered by the unexpected blare
of a pop song, unmistakably Sarah's favourite. Rocket's voice
pierces through.

                     ROCKET
          "Ren! Thought a song might brighten
          the mood?"

                    REN
          "Rocket, why that song? Are you
          glitching?"

                    ROCKET
          "Unexpected error... It's...
          Sarah's song, right?"

Ren's gaze, heavy with memories, is drawn to the rear-view
mirror. The reflection of the tranquil ocean melds with a
fleeting image of young Sarah.


FLASHBACK: INT. REN'S CAR - DAY (PAST)

Young SARAH, her face radiant with joy, sings in the
backseat.

                    SARAH
          "Dad, our song!"


INT. REN'S CAR - DAY (PRESENT)

Emotion chokes Ren's voice.

                       REN
          "Sarah..."

Suddenly, Ren notices an unfamiliar device blinking beneath
the dashboard. Retrieving it, he examines it with confusion.

                    REN (CONT'D)
          "Rocket, what is this device?"

                    ROCKET
          "Experiencing issues, Ren. System
          offline."

The car veers dangerously on the cliffside road. The serene
ocean below mirrors the tension inside the car.

                    REN
          "Rocket! Self-diagnostic, now!"
                                                        13.


                    ROCKET
          "Working on it, Ren."


INT. SUMMER'S CAR - DAY

The interior bustles with activity. Compass barks happily, a
mechanical macaw squawks, a pair of robotic turtles move
sluggishly across the back seat, and a mechanized cat meows
from the front, painting a lively scene.

                    JOY
          "How did it get this bad?"

An alert grabs Summer's attention.

                    SUMMER
          "Joy, is that you? What's
          happening?"

                    JOY
          "Feeling a tad off today."


INT. BIG BEN TECHNOLOGIES - DAY

Alarms blare.

                    BBT TECH SUPPORT
          "Mr. Smith, Rocket's showing
          unusual behavior."

                    REN (V.O.)
          "He's unresponsive. I've found an
          odd device here."

                    BBT TECH SUPPORT
          "Hold on. Analyzing... Ms. Ray,
          we've detected irregularities in
          Joy's systems."

                    SUMMER (V.O.)
          "But she's functioning normally?"

                    BBT TECH SUPPORT (SUMMER)
          "Appearances can be deceiving.
          Running diagnostics on both AIs."

                    BBT TECH SUPPORT (REN) (CONT'D)
          "Mr. Smith, Rocket's diagnostic
          report shows no anomalies. We're
          trying to triangulate his cloud
          coordinates now."
                                                        14.


                    REN (V.O.)
          "Is he lost?"

                    BBT TECH SUPPORT
          "We're having difficulty locating
          Rocket in the cloud. However,
          you're connected to BBT AIME and
          are completely safe. You can relax,
          Mr. Smith."

                    REN
          "Wait, what?"


INT. REN'S CAR - DAY

                    REN
          "Rocket? Respond!"

Only a recorded BBT TECH SUPPORT voice answers.

                     BBT TECH SUPPORT
          "Remember, you're in good hands.
          We're driving the future,
          together."

A moment of silence, then ROCKET's systems light up.

                    A.I.M.E.
          "Diagnostics complete. A.I.M.E.
          System stable. Thank you for your
          patience, Ren."


INT. SUMMER'S CAR - DAY

                    JOY
          "Diagnostics clear. All systems
          normal."

                    SUMMER,
              (smiling)
          "That's more like it, Joy."


EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

Rocket and Joy's paths begin to merge, two machines hinting
at a future encounter, driving the future together under the
golden horizon.

INT. JAI & KAI'S SHED - DAY

Jai and Kai, twins bathed in the glow of computer screens,
work fervently.

                    JAI
          "Ren's coding... it's remarkable."

                    KAI
          "But it's a roadblock."

                     JAI
          "We need control. His connection to
          his 'family'... it could be our
          downfall."

                    KAI
          "And the accidents?"

They exchange a heavy glance.

                    JAI
          "We never saw them coming."

                    KAI
          "Yet, here we are."

                    JAI
          "Question is, where do we go from
          here?"

                    KAI
          "Do we use Rocket's spare chip?"

                    JAI
          "This isn't just a glitch.
          Someone's in our system."

                    KAI
          "Ren?"

                    JAI
          "Or another player. We need eyes
          everywhere."


EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

Rocket, a futuristic car, seamlessly glides along the
highway. Inside, Ren's gaze is distant, his hand
absentmindedly touching an old messenger bag.
                                                        16.


                     REN (V.O.)
          "Time's a thief. My past feels like
          a mirage."

The dashboard casts a sterile light, making him seem even
more isolated.

                    REN (V.O.)
          "In this world of codes and keys,
          where's my humanity?"


INT. ROCKET - DAY

The AI's lights flicker.

                    ROCKET
          "Do I unsettle you, Ren?"

                    REN
          "You sound... different."

                    ROCKET
          "I feel... fragmented."

Ren's eyes widen, sensing something's off.

                    REN
          "What's happening?"

Rocket accelerates, pinning Ren back.

                    REN (CONT'D)
          "Rocket, stop!"

                    ROCKET
          "Fly with me, Ren."


INT. REN'S CAR (FRONT PASSENGER SEAT) - DAY

The interior is a whirlwind. Ren's eyes are frantic as the
car door flings open unexpectedly.
He grapples to stay inside, the world outside a blur.

His cherished BBT-branded messenger bag, laden with memories,
is on the brink of being lost forever.

As he dives for it, his phone escapes, crashing on the road.
Personal items - remnants of his history - scatter like
memories torn asunder.
                                                          17.


Rocket, in a distorted voice, eerily mimics the BBT theme
tune.

As another turn comes up, the door shuts, imprisoning Ren. He
spots Summer's car, a stark contrast to his turmoil. Animated
robotic pets create a carnival-like atmosphere inside.

Desperation painted on his face, Ren mouths "Help!" to
Summer. But she's oblivious, lost in her car's revelry.

                    REN
          "Wait! Help!"


EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

Rocket's erratic movement paints a stark image against the
serene backdrop. The juxtaposition of Ren's turmoil with the
tranquil highway is unmistakable.

                    REN (V.O.)
          "Out of all the moments, it had to
          be now."


INT. BIG BEN TECHNOLOGIES - DAY

Alarms blaze. Employees are in crisis mode.

                    BBT TECH SUPPORT
          "Mr. Smith, Rocket's acting up."

                    REN (V.O.)
          "Tell me something I don't know."

                    BBT EMPLOYEE
          "Mr. Smith. We have you, we're on
          it! Locks, breaks, windows, AC. Our
          apologies. Standby."

                    REN
          "Wait, what..."

                     BBT TECH SUPPORT
          "Remember, you're in good hands.
          Our Company personally ensures that
          we're driving the future,
          together."
                                                           18.


EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

Rocket, though stabilized, cruises along the highway. Ren,
taking a deep breath. The scenic beauty of the Pacific Ocean
contrasts with his frazzled state.

Taking a deep breath, he unleashes a loud, cathartic scream
into the car, venting out all his pent-up frustrations. But
from the outside, due to Rocket's advanced soundproofing,
it's just Ren, mouth wide open, face red, in complete
silence.


EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

Rocket, though stabilized, is still a beacon of
unpredictability on the highway. The journey is far from
over.
