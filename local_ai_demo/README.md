# Local AI Demo Setup

This folder contains scripts to run Zephyr (LLM), Whisper (speech-to-text), and Stable Diffusion (image generation) locally on your CPU using Python.

## Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
2. Open a terminal in this folder.
3. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the scripts:
- `zephyr_demo.py` for text generation
- `whisper_demo.py` for speech-to-text
- `stable_diffusion_demo.py` for image generation

---

Each script will download the required model the first time it runs. You can edit the scripts to change prompts, file names, or other settings as needed.
