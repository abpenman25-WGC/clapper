# Release process

## Releasing the whole app

### Web version (push to clapper.app)

TODO

### Desktop version (build the Electron app)

## Releasing individual modules

Core package dependencies in the monorepo are defined using "workspace:*"

But to release them as NPM modules, you need to replace "workspace:*" by the actual version number
