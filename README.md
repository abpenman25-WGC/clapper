## Introduction

ðŸŽ¬ Clapper is a work-in-progress video editor made for the AI age

## Instructions for developers

During development we can use a path like this to quickly test:

```
 "@aitube/timeline": "file:/Users/jbilcke/Projects/Typescript_Libraries/aitube-timeline",
```

Your local copy of the aitube-timelien will have to be built using:

```bash
bun run build:dev
```

to build with the jsxDEV enabled.

If you don't, you will see errors and warnings such as

```
app-index.js:33 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
```
