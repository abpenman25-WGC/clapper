# Introduction

ðŸŽ¬ Clapper is an open-source AI story visualization tool.

Clapper can interpret a screenplay and render it to storyboards, videos, voice, sound and music.

Please note however that the tool is at an early stage of development, for the moment it is not supposed to be really used by "normal" people (some features don't work, there are no tutorials etc).

# Badges

# Contributing

## For users or corporations

### Sponsor specific features

You can propose bounties attached to issues (eg `"add support for Adobe Premiere Pro export"`, `"finish .fbx integration"`) and open-source community members will be able to submit pull requests to solve them.

There are various platforms to do this, I propose to try Boss as it has low fees: [boss.dev](https://www.boss.dev/doc/#create-bounties)

Please use good judgment if you take on a bounty. Post a message in the GitHub thread, communicate on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AEruz9B92B) that you are going to take it to avoid double efforts etc.
